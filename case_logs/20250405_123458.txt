=== Case Summary ===
In the case of the terminated employee seeking unemployment insurance compensation in the UAE:

1. **Eligibility for Compensation**: The employee appears eligible for compensation as they were enrolled in the UAE Unemployment Insurance Scheme during their employment and were terminated without disciplinary action after more than a year of service.

2. **Application Process and Duration of Payments**: The employee must apply for compensation through the appropriate government portal or office handling unemployment insurance claims in the UAE. The specifics of the application process can vary, so it's advisable to consult the relevant authority or official website. The duration for which unemployment benefits are paid typically depends on the specific regulations of the insurance scheme and the employee's previous contributions.

3. **Amount of Compensation**: The compensation amount is generally not fixed and is likely based on the employee's salary, subject to a cap defined by the unemployment insurance law. The exact percentage of the salary that will be compensated and any maximum limits should be verified with the unemployment insurance authority.

The employee should gather all necessary documentation, including employment and termination details, and promptly initiate the application process to ensure they receive the benefits they are entitled to under the law.
