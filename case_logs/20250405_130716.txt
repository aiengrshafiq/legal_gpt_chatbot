Case: Terminated Employee Seeking Unemployment Insurance Compensation 
 
I was working at a private sector company in the UAE and was terminated without disciplinary 
action after 13 consecutive months of employment. I was enrolled in the UAE Unemployment 
Insurance Scheme throughout my employment, and my basic salary was AED 12,000. 
 
I have not yet found another job, and I want to apply for compensation under the unemployment 
insurance law. 
 
Questions: 
1. Am I eligible for compensation based on my current situation? 
2. What is the process for applying and how long will I receive payments? 
3. Is the amount fixed or based on my salary? 
 
 


=== Legal Advice ===
1. Based on the information provided, you are eligible for compensation under the UAE Unemployment Insurance Scheme. You meet the eligibility requirements by having been enrolled in the scheme throughout your employment and having completed a minimum subscription period of 12 consecutive months. Additionally, your termination was not due to disciplinary reasons, which aligns with the conditions outlined for compensation eligibility.

2. The process for applying for compensation typically involves submitting a claim through the service providers licensed by the Central Bank or through any other designated government entity assigned to handle such claims. The compensation is provided for a period of three months from the date of unemployment.

3. The compensation amount is not fixed but is based on your salary. It is calculated at 60 percent of your contribution salary, up to a maximum of Dhs. 20,000 per month. Since your basic salary was AED 12,000, you would receive 60 percent of this amount, which equals AED 7,200 per month, for the duration of three months, assuming no other income sources or re-employment during this period.
