Case: Terminated Employee Seeking Unemployment Insurance Compensation 
 
I was working at a private sector company in the UAE and was terminated without disciplinary 
action after 13 consecutive months of employment. I was enrolled in the UAE Unemployment 
Insurance Scheme throughout my employment, and my basic salary was AED 12,000. 
 
I have not yet found another job, and I want to apply for compensation under the unemployment 
insurance law. 
 
Questions: 
1. Am I eligible for compensation based on my current situation? 
2. What is the process for applying and how long will I receive payments? 
3. Is the amount fixed or based on my salary? 
 
 


=== Legal Advice ===
1. Based on the provided documents, you are eligible for compensation under the Unemployment Insurance Scheme. The eligibility requirements include a minimum subscription period of 12 consecutive months, and you mentioned being employed and enrolled in the scheme for 13 consecutive months. Additionally, your termination was without disciplinary action, which aligns with the eligibility conditions.

2. The process for applying for compensation is not detailed in the provided documents. You may need to consult the specific procedures set by the UAE Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation or the service provider managing the Unemployment Insurance Scheme.

3. The amount of compensation is based on your salary. According to the documents, the compensation is 60 percent of the contribution salary for a period of three months, up to a maximum of Dhs.20,000 per month. Since your basic salary was AED 12,000, you would receive 60 percent of this amount, which equals AED 7,200 per month, for three months.
